# Schema.org to Dublin Core Map
The XML file hosted here is an experimental version of a proposed RDF mapping from schema.org to Dublin Core.

You may view a representation of the file using [LODE](<http://www.essepuntato.it/lode/https://raw.github.com/jonphipps/Example-Map/master/mappings_schema.org.xml>) or [Parrot](http://ontorule-project.eu/parrot/parrot?documentUri=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.github.com%2Fjonphipps%2FExample-Map%2Fmaster%2Fmappings_schema.org.xml&mimetype=default&profile=technical&language=en&customizeCssUrl=#anchor198008789)

At the moment, neither of these representations is particularly satisfactory.
